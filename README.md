Guides will follow over time, depending on general interest. This is not a simple code base! Specific rules and workflows must be used.
This project is made public for observation. The Project was originally made with Unity 2018 (before neste Prefabs!) and then updated to the 2019.4.40f1 LTS version.

## Contents and Infos
* There is good code and bad code collected over a decade. This does not reflect my current personal standards.
* A custom multithreadded Pathfinder (A* and Flowfields)
* A custom async LOD system with certain benefits
* A mesh merging and automation tool including a simple character generator
* Custom Localization system
* Savegame and game settings system
* An Entity-Component System with a specific workflow to be careful about. If you recieve an Error when making changes first validate the data. Code is more efficient because we assume that Entity data is always correct.
* A system of AI, city building and economy. Daytime cycles, energy management etc.
